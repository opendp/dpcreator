DP Creator is a web application which guides users in the creation of [differentially private statistics](https://opendp.org/about#whatisdifferentialprivacy). Using the [OpenDP library](https://github.com/opendp/opendp) at its core, DP Creator has been designed to work with data repositories, with initial integration beginning with [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/), an open source research data repository. 

DP Creator is part of the larger [OpenDP Project](https://opendp.org), a community effort to build trustworthy, open source software tools for analysis of private data. 

## Status

DP Creator is under development and we expect to have a test version, connected to a example Dataverse installation publicly available this fall.

The application is designed to be deployed using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and the development environment is available through [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
