home,stepsDescription,"DP Creator allows researchers to create high utility statistics using differential privacy (DP). Through a carefully calibrated process, the application of DP introduces random noise to a data file in order to keep an individual's information protected. The resulting DP statistics are usable by researchers while masking the contribution of any single individual--making it impossible to infer any information specific to an individual.",DP Creator allows researchers to easily <strong>introduce noise into variables</strong> masking specific details to <strong>keep private data private</strong>.

more information,epsilon title,Privacy Budgeting and Epsilon (&epsilon;)?,
more information,epsilon text,"<p>If you are not familiar with differential privacy, one analogy for privacy budgeting is going clothes shopping with a fixed budget. With a fixed budget you can only purchase so many items and have to prioritize which pieces are most important for your wardrobe.</p>
<p>Within differential privacy, the privacy budget is known as epsilon, denoted by the Greek letter <b>&epsilon;</b>.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say your epsilon, or privacy budget, is 1.0. When you are at the stage of selecting DP statistics to calculate, you can decide how much epsilon to ""spend."" For example, suppose your data file contains the variable ""Age"" and you want to ""buy"", or calculate, the DP mean of Age. You could start by ""spending,"" or budgeting, 0.5 epsilon for that statistic.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Statistic:</b> DP Mean of Age</li>
<li><b>Budget/Epsilon &epsilon;:</b> 0.5 </li>
</ul><br />
<p>At this point, <i>before</i> running an actual calculation or touching the source data file, DP Creator can determine an error measure for the calculation. In the example below, with a Confidence Level set to 95%, the error is 0.479:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Statistic:</b> DP Mean of Age</li>
<li><b>Budget/Epsilon &epsilon;:</b> 0.5 </li>
<li><b>Error:</b> 0.479</li>
<li><b>What it means:</b><br />
There is 95% confidence that the DP Mean will be within 0.479 years of the actual mean age.</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As may be seen above, with an &epsilon; of <b>0.5</b>, the error is <b>0.479</b>. Now, what if you used less &epsilon;, say 0.25?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Statistic:</b> DP Mean of Age</li>
<li><b>Budget/Epsilon &epsilon;:</b> 0.25 </li>
<li><b>Error:</b> 0.959 </li>
<li><b>What it means:</b><br />
There is 95% confidence that the DP Mean will be within 0.959 years of the actual mean age.</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, using less &epsilon; <i>increases</i> the error, giving stronger privacy protection but less accuracy.</p>
<p>In contrast, what happens when more &epsilon; is allocated for the same statistic? Say 0.75:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Statistic:</b> DP Mean of Age</li>
<li><b>Budget/Epsilon &epsilon;:</b> 0.75 </li>
<li><b>Error:</b> 0.320 </li>
<li><b>What it means:</b><br />
There is 95% confidence that the DP Mean will be within 0.320 years of the actual mean age.</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking through this example, using more &epsilon; <i>decreases</i> the error, giving less privacy protection but more accuracy.</p>
<p>These examples show how increasing or decreasing the epsilon, or privacy budget, changes the error, impacting the privacy/accuracy of the statistic. </p>
<table style=""border: 1px solid #1658a3;text-align:center;"" cellspacing=""15"" cellpadding=""10"">
<tr>
<th>epsilon</th>
<th>error/accuracy</th>

<tr>
<td>0.25</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.50</td>
<td>0.479</td>

</tr>
</table><br />
<p>The relationship between epsilon and error/accuracy may be described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower <b>&epsilon;</b> value --> higher error --> stronger privacy, less accuracy</li>
<li>Higher <b>&epsilon;</b> value --> lower error --> weaker privacy, more accuracy</li>
</ul><br />
<p>Again, this accuracy/error measure may be determined <i>before</i> running the actual calculation. This allows you to experiment with different statistics and epsilon allocations before calculating the DP statistics. It is simillar to adding/removing/editing items in an online shopping cart before committing to a purchase.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, <b>&epsilon;</b> should be thought of as a small number, between approximately 1/100 and 1.</p>
<p><i>(Note: This information has been excerpted from the book chapter <a href=""https://admindatahandbook.mit.edu/book/v1.0/diffpriv.html"" target=""_blank"">Designing Access with Differential Privacy</a>, which also contains illustrative examples.)</i></p>",
more information,delta title,What is delta (&delta;)?,
more information,delta text,"<p>Delta (&delta;) is a second privacy-loss parameter used when calculating some differentially private statistics.</p>  

<p>This parameter  controls the probability that a privacy breach event would happen, and hence should be kept
very small (e.g., one in a billion).</p>  ",
more information,inferred-types title,Variable Types,
more information,inferred-types text,"<p>When DP Creator first reads a data file, it attempts to infer each variable type, distinguishing between: Boolean, Categorical, Float, and Integer.</p>
<p>However, this inference may not be correct and needs to be double-checked by the user! Without checking, a privacy violation may occur.</p>
<p>For example, a dataset variable may be inferred to be <b>Boolean</b> because only two values for that variable appear in the data file. However, there may be more possible values that are not present in the data. The <i>absence</i> of those values may result in a privacy violation.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretend all people can one have one of three possible shape biomarkers: circle, square, and trapezoid--and trapezoid is associated with a fatal disease.</li>
<li>A dataset on people living in Sunrise Beach, Los Angeles is loaded into DP Creator and the ShapeBiomarker variable includes the values circle and trapezoid (the fatal shape) but not square.
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>All possible values:</b> circle, square, and trapezoid
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Values in the dataset</b>: circle, trapezoid
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Incorrect Type inference</b>: Boolean
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Actual Type</b>: Categorical
</li>
<li>Finding only two values in the dataset, DP Creator infers it to be type <b>Boolean</b></li>
<li>If the type is not corrected to <b>Categorical</b> and a histogram is run on the ShapeBiomarker variable, someone with knowledge of shape biomarkers will be able to learn that no one in Sunrise Beach has the ShapeBiomarker ""square.""</li>
<li>Depending on the histogram values, the size of Sunrise Beach, and available adjacent data someone may be able to identify people who have the fatal trapezoid biomarker.</li>
<li>A serious privacy violation has occurred!</li>
